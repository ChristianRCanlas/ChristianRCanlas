# Project Highlights

1. [Time-Series Decomposition](https://github.com/ChristianRCanlas/ChristianRCanlas.github.io/blob/main/07.%20R%20Markdown%20Documents/Time-Series%20Decomposition.Rmd)

    - I elaborate on how to interpret and use time-series decomposition to analyze data. It covers methods to extract trend, seasonal, and residual components, providing practical guidance on applying these techniques.

2. [Time-Series Forecasting Versus Traditional Manufacturing](https://github.com/ChristianRCanlas/ChristianRCanlas.github.io/blob/main/07.%20R%20Markdown%20Documents/Time-Series%20Forecasting%20Versus%20Traditional%20Manufacturing%20Forecasting.Rmd)

    - I provide a detailed analysis on time-series forecasting techniques versus traditional manufacturing forecasting methods.

3. [Hierarchical Forecasting in Python](https://github.com/ChristianRCanlas/ChristianRCanlas.github.io/blob/main/01.%20Hierarchical%20Forecasting/Hierarchical%20Forecasting%20in%20Python.ipynb)

    - I demonstrate how to apply hierarchical forecasting methods to aggregated datasets. In my project, I explore techniques for forecasting at different levels of data aggregation, showcasing practical implementation in Python.

4. [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Forecasting in Python](https://github.com/ChristianRCanlas/ChristianRCanlas.github.io/blob/main/05.%20Long%20Short-Term%20Memory%20(LSTM)/LSTM%20Forecasting%20in%20Python.ipynb)

    - I showcase a LSTM model I used for time-series forecasting tasks in Python, leveraging deep learning for improved accuracy.

5. [Support Vector Regression (SVR) Forecasting in Python](https://github.com/ChristianRCanlas/ChristianRCanlas.github.io/blob/main/06.%20Support%20Vector%20Regression%20(SVR)/SVR%20in%20Python.ipynb)

    - In this project, I elaborate on the application of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for time-series forecasting. I emphasize SVR's capability to handle non-linear relationships in data, demonstrating its use in predictive modeling.
